// You have k apple boxes full of apples. Each square box of size m contains m Ã— m apples. You just noticed two interesting properties about the boxes:

// The smallest box is size 1, the next one is size 2,..., all the way up to size k.
// Boxes that have an odd size contain only yellow apples. Boxes that have an even size contain only red apples.
// Your task is to calculate the difference between the number of red apples and the number of yellow apples.

// Example

// For k = 5, the output should be
// appleBoxes(k) = -15.

// There are 1 + 3 * 3 + 5 * 5 = 35 yellow apples and 2 * 2 + 4 * 4 = 20 red apples, making the answer 20 - 35 = -15.

function appleBoxes(k) {
  // odd yellow - even red
  let redApples = 0;
  let yellowApples = 0;
  for(let i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
      if(i % 2 === 0) {
          redApples += Math.pow(i, 2);
      } else {
          yellowApples += Math.pow(i, 2);
      }
  }
  return redApples - yellowApples;
}
